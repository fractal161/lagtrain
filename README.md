# Lagtrain (NES)


NES homebrew that recreates [Lagtrain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnIhRpIT7nc) by inabakumori. In addition to the source itself, this repository also contains scripts and tools used to convert the animation and song into a format that can be played on a NES.

## Setup
Currently, the only dependencies are `numpy` and `opencv-contrib-python`, which you can install using `pip`. In addition, the animation and song stems can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12jTtX4Jcl4-yoyjSLYISnZOUwC9hhoGV), which is also linked in the official video's description.
